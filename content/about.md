title: About
description_one: I am a passionate tech enthusiast driven by high quality work product and an ardent admirer of creative work. I am always on the lookout for exploring new creations and innovations. As I am developing this portfolio I have been dipping my toes into UI/UX reasearch and it's simply awesome!! Lately I have been working at a fintech startup in NYC where I build (break and fix!!) awesome web and mobile UI/UX features using some cutting edge tools & technolgies like React, GraphQL, React-Native, styled components, Material UI etc. Prior to that, I worked on various freelance projects around UI development and data analysis using Gastby, React, JavaScript, Python, SQL, etc.  Before migrating to the USA, I worked on some really cool apps like Automobile Navigation UI and product websites at multinational and mid-size organizations in India .
description_two: Having worked in various environments, heirarchy and different project management approaches, I am a staunch believer of  team work. Only a great team collaboration can drive successful product. And that is why, I strive to create a positive and supportive culture. My colleagues often find me as self starter, highly organized and a great collaborator. When not coding, you can find me taking long walks, reading inspirational books, cooking or playing video games.
