title: About
description_one: I am a software engineer by profession, a problem solver by passion and a lover of innovations by heart. I am always keen to learn new technologies and explore new ideas.  After graduating from NJIT in May 2018, I worked on some freelance projects and eventually joined a fintech startup where I built (and fixed!!) web and mobile applications using some cutting edge tools & technolgies like React, GraphQL, React-Native etc. Before migrating to the USA 4 years ago, I worked for about 2 years in India at multinational and mid-size organizations as a Software Engineer.
description_two: Having worked on various professional and freelance projects for more than 3 years, I firmly believe that only a great team collaboration can yield the best results. Hence, I always give my best towards creating a great work culture in a team. When not coding, you can find me taking long walks, reading inspirational books, cooking and playing video games.
